> A docs-build notebook processor that color-codes cells by boopiter
> type, so the rendered site echoes the app’s colored left bars.

<div class="boopcell boop-note">

Registered via `doc_procs` in `pyproject.toml [tool.nbdev]`,
`color_cells` runs over every notebook during the docs build (before
Quarto renders). It wraps each markdown/raw cell’s source in a Quarto
fenced div classed by its boopiter cell type (`.boop-note` green,
`.boop-prompt` red, `.boop-raw` orange); `styles.css` turns those into
the colored left bar. Code cells already carry `.cell-code`, so they’re
colored in CSS alone. The page’s H1 title cell is left untouched so
Quarto’s title handling isn’t disturbed.

</div>

::: {.cell 0=‘e’ 1=‘x’ 2=‘p’ 3=‘o’ 4=‘r’ 5=‘t’}

``` python
import re

# a Prompt+Reply markdown cell (solveit encoding) carries this separator -- see serialize.py
_SEP_RE = re.compile(r'##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_[0-9a-f]+ -->')

def color_cells(cell):
    "nbdev docs processor: wrap a markdown/raw cell's source in a Quarto fenced div classed by its boopiter cell type, so styles.css can draw boopiter's colored left bar (green note / red prompt / orange raw).

Overwrites in place: the directory is named from the notebook's identity (see share_slug), so a correction updates the page a recipient already has the link to.
